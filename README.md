📖 Project Description

AI-Based Safe Surfing System is a child-friendly web search platform designed to protect young users from accessing inappropriate or harmful online content. The system uses a hybrid content moderation approach that combines:

Static Blocklist Filtering – Detects and blocks known harmful keywords, including disguised or misspelled terms.

Pattern Recognition – Identifies unsafe content attempts through altered spellings and slang.

AI-Powered Contextual Moderation – Uses the OpenAI Moderation API to analyze ambiguous queries and understand the intent behind them.

The platform classifies each search query into Safe, Blocked, or Under Review, providing instant feedback and suggesting safe, educational alternatives when possible. It features:

A colorful, intuitive interface designed for children.

Real-time feedback with friendly alerts when unsafe searches are blocked.

A curated list of educational resources (e.g., National Geographic Kids, Khan Academy Kids).
